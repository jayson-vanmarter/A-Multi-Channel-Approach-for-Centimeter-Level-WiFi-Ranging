# A Multi-Channel Approach for Centimeter-Level WiFi Ranging

This repository contains the data and code related to our paper "A Multi-Channel Approach and Testbed for Centimeter-Level WiFi Ranging" (under review). This work proposes methods for phase-coherent multi-channel (PCMC) WiFi ranging using timestamp and CFR measurements supporting 802.11az Next Generation Positioning. Utilizing our proposed PCMC technique with 16 channels, we demonstrate a median error of 2.7 cm and a 90th percentile error of 9.5 cm in line-of-sight conditions.

Full data set will be released upon paper acceptance.
