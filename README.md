# Phase-Coherent Multi-Channel WiFi Ranging

This repository contains the data and code related to our paper "Coherent Multi-Channel WiFi Ranging for Next Generation Positioning" (under review). This work proposes methods for coherent multi-channel WiFi ranging using timestamp and CFR measurements supporting Next Generation Positioning. Utilizing our proposed PCMC technique with 16 channels, we demonstrate a median error of 2.7 cm and a 90th percentile error of 9.5 cm in line-of-sight conditions.
